Do you hate reading? .....clearly not beacuse you scrolled down to a README, nerd. 

But lets assume you do, then boy howdy do we have the product for you!

Picture this, you stop at the hot new botanical garden in town, when all of a sudden you're visually assaulted by rows and rows of informational plaques. How are you supposed to mellow out and enjoy nature when the man made signs blocking the view expect to be read. It's a ~~not so~~ scientific fact that the chemicals your brain emits while reading anything longer than a paragraph permanently decreases your ability to experience happiness. Well we say no more of that, with the ARboretum project we've found a way to perfectly encapuslate the joy of learning without melting your brain. Through an engaging mix of AR, audio, and ***LIGHT*** readings, you'll be able to learn more about plants than any person should ever need to know while still feeling as fresh as a daisy. 

# How to use it

Do you own a phone, tablet, laptop, or literally any other device with camera and browser functionality?

If you answered yes, then congrats! You're one step closer to experiecing the beauty of virtual plant life and learning.

If you answered no, then, sorry pal, clearly plants are the wrong green thing to focus on in your life. 

## Passed the de-vibe check

While you have succededig in your first test of the digital classroom, the path ahead is not without obstacles. 

To proceed onward, you must display your skill in accessing a website. Only the most brave and brilliant of you are expected to suceed. For starters, there is the daunting task of finding the url: https://mia-ktlk.github.io/ARboretum/app.html. Following this is a near impossible hurdle: making a choice. 

Those lucky few who manage to uncover the secret application at https://mia-ktlk.github.io/ARboretum/app.html will find themselves with many paths before them. Not only are there many choices of topic but also educational depth (but hold your horses, we'll explain that more down below). Once the agonizing problem of finding the correct choive has been solved, there reamins only 1 more step until you will be able to find true eductional enlightenment.


## Like hitting the broad side of greenhouse

For your final trial, you are being asked to *aim*.

While for some this may be a more dauting task than others, so long as you don't hail from a family of stormtroppers you should be just fine. 

With your topic and level chosen, you are only left to proceed to our big, beautiful, brag-worthy, blue, button labled 'AR.' This is where the fun begins.

By pressing that button, you will be teleported to another dimension within your phone, the ARboretum camera realm. Within this plane, to unlock the prize of learning you must point your camera at a block
